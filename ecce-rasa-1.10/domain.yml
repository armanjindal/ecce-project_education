  utter_fractions_introduction_1:
  - text: Whoop! Fractions it is. First we are going to talk about sharing food with
      your friends!
  utter_fractions_halves_1:
  - text: Imagine you are at {school} and it is lunch time. You only have one {object_1}
      left in your tiffin and your friend, {friend_1} forgot to bring their food.

    text: Let’s try this again! Which split of {object_1} do you think is fair to
      the both of you?
  utter_fractions_halves_mcq_1_explanation:
  - text: The correct answer is C. Because when you split {object_1} like that, both
      you and {friend_1} get the same, or equal, amount. You are splitting the {object_1}
      in half!
  utter_fractions_halves_mcq_1-1_explanation:
  - text: The correct answer is D. The {object_1} has been split into equal halves!
  utter_fractions_halves_conclusion:
  - text: In fractions we would say that you and {friend_1} each got one half (½)
      of {object_1}!
  utter_fractions_halves_conclusion_animation:
  - text: Here is a short video showing the idea https://youtu.be/D9q89rcvNIs
  utter_start_next:
  - text: Are you ready to start the next mini-lesson?
  utter_fractions_parts_introduction_1:
  - text: Right after you and {friend_1} finished your yummy (and equal share!) of
      your last {object_1} another friend, {friend_2} joins you just as you were about
      to split your 6 (six) {object_2}!
  utter_fractions_parts_introduction_2:
  - text: Now the three of you need to share {object_2} equally.
  utter_ask_fractions_parts_nrq_1:
  - text: How many of the 6 (six) {object_2} do you each get if you split them equally?
  utter_fractions_parts_nrq_1_explanation:
  - text: You each get 2 because 6 split equally (divided) by 3 is 2.

    text: Tell us in fractions, what share of the {object_2} did you and your two
      friends get?
  utter_fractions_parts_mcq_1_explanation:
  - text: Since you are breaking down a whole object into three equal parts the fraction
      is (⅓)
  utter_fractions_parts_mcq_2:
  - buttons:
    - payload: /correct
      title: More
    - payload: /mcq_incorrect
      title: Less
    text: If {friend_2} never came, and you only had to split the {object_2} with
      {friend_1} would each person get more or less?
  utter_fractions_parts_mcq_2_explanation:
  - text: Because there are fewer people to share with, each person's share goes up.
  utter_fractions_parts_mcq_3:
  - buttons:
    - payload: /mcq_correct
      title: Yes
    - payload: /mcq_incorrect
      title: No
    text: Remebering the last question, is 1/2 a larger share than 1/3 of the 6 {object_2}?
  utter_fractions_parts_mcq_3_explanation:
  - text: ½ is fraction that splits the whole object into two equal parts. ⅓ is a
      fraction that splits a whole into three equal parts. When you split an object
      into more equal parts the size of these parts becomes smaller!
  utter_fractions_parts_conclusion_1:
  - text: After you went through the trouble of using fractions, {friend_1} changes
      his mind and decides he does not want any {object_2}. So, {friend_1} gives you
      his part.
  utter_fractions_parts_conclusion_2:
  - text: After you used fractions to split the {object_2} into 3 equal parts, you
      now have 2 of these parts and {friend_1} has 1.
  utter_fractions_parts_conclusion_3:
  - text: In fractions, we would say that you have two-out-of-three or two-thirds
      (⅔) of the whole. Here is a short animation which shows this!
