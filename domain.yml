  utter_ask_why:
  - text: Why do you think it is fair?
  utter_halves_a1:
  - text: The correct answer is C. That is the 'fair' split. Why is this fair? Because
      both parts are the SAME size or EQUAL amount.
  utter_halves_a1-1:
  - text: The correct answer is D.
  utter_incorrect:
  - text: That is not quite right!
  utter_correct:

      your last {object_1} another friend, {friend_2} comes says hi, just as you were

    - payload: /incorrect
      title: Less
    text: If {friend_2} never came, would you and {friend_1} get more or less than
      compared to before?
  utter_parts_story:
  - text: After you went through the trouble of using fractions, {friend_1} changes
      his mind and does not want any {object_2}. {friend_1} gives you their part.
      So, the {object_2} has been divided into 3 equal parts. You now have 2 of these
      parts and {friend_1} has 1. In fractions, we would say that you have two-out-of-three
      or two-thirds (⅔) of the whole.
