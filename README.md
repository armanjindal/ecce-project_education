This project is a demo to showcase the capabilities of Conversational AI used for education. We aim to improve and democratize conversational lessons at Ecce Education.

Vision: 

At Ecce Education, we provide students with an interactive, personalized tutor only a text away. Students chat with Ecce, our conversational AI, who guides them through an expanding repository of lessons: answering questions, giving hints, sharing funny GIFS, and, when needed, providing motivation and support. Ecce is available on Whatsapp; a user interface that Indian's interact with the most, making our product available to anyone with a phone.

Ecce is a one-stop destination for conversational lessons, powered by the people who know students best: teachers, educational organizations, and edtech companies. We partner with edtech companies and educational organizations to create conversational lessons that can integrate with their platform. Our free and open-source tools enable teachers to create multimedia conversational lessons with ease. We curate the best lessons for our students, making them available through Ecce - learning is always a text away.

This project is not yet set up for open-source contributions. But if you are interested, and passionate in the area we are working in please get in touch with me (arman.jindal@columbia.edu), and I am happy to hop on a call to talk about the current design, where it is headed and the goal of our MVP. Our technology built ontop of Rasa will **always** remain free to use and open-source for teachers. At this stage we are working heavily with the Rasa tech stack.
