# Ecce Education - MVP

This is an early stage MVP. The goal is to make this for any teacher to create lessons and add it to the regional version of the Ecce, our Conversational AI, so  users can speak to it in vernacular langages and mixed dialects. 

Currently the MVP is centeted on a lesson on fraction. The lesson plan is based on "script" doc the teams is working on in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgeUIaqbyBnGFTDRHN3YF5hKgZFWIs5CE3sVX9yHKT0/edit?usp=sharing). Using this single lesson as a test case we are developing the right abstractions for teachers to easily create lesson without worrying about the nuances and fail safe behaviors of conversational AI assistants - so they can focus on what they do best: creativley and effectivley teaching the next generation (remotley for now!). Eventually we will turn this into an easy-to-use, drag-drop, graphical interface (sort of like Wix). Right now it is GoogleDocs :)

This project is not yet set up for open-source contributions. But if you are interested, and passionate in the area we are working in please get in touch with me (arman.jindal@columbia.edu), and I am happy to hop on a call to talk about the current design, where it is headed and the goal of our MVP. Our technology built ontop of Rasa will **always** remain free to use and open-source for teachers. At this stage we are working heavily with the Rasa tech stack. To know more abou the incredibly interesting, well designed, and awesome open source project check out their [website](https://rasa.com/)
