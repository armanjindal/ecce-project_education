    - 12 mangoes
    - 5
    - 29
    - 21
    - 8
    - 2
    - 4
    - i am 8
    - 27
    - 22
    - 12
    - 25
    - If I have split them equally it would be 2 grapes for each of us
    - There are 4 mangoes in each box
    - The whole is the box of 4 mangoes!
    - I am 8 years old!
    - Well we each get 2
    - I m 11 year old
    - 4 in each box
    - I think it would be 2 biscuits each
    - There are exactly 4 mangoes in each box
    - There are 4 in each box
    - I think I get 2 biscuits
    - 1/4
    - 1/5
    - i got 1/3
    - we get 7 each
    - 14
    - 23
    - 20
    - Each person get 1/4 of the whole
    - Oh then it is 1/4
    - Since we are splitting something into 3 equal parts it is 1/3
    - 1/3 because the split is in 3 boxes
    - So my answer is 1/4
    - Hmmm okay! The new whole is just a mangoe, so the fraction each person gets is 1/4
    - Hmm I think there are 1/3
    - 2/4
    - 1/4 of the mangoes in each box
    - I am 8
    - There is 1/4 of the whole in each box
