  utter_fractions_halves_introduction:
  - text: Yay! Let's start with halves by talking about my favorite thing - food!
  utter_ask_1_friend_1:
  - text: Which of your friends do you like to eat with the most?
  utter_question_2_fractions_halves_mcq_1:
  - image: https://ecceapi.herokuapp.com/media/fractions_halves_mcq_1.png
    text: |-
      Imagine it is lunch time at {school} and {1_friend_1} want to have some of your last {object_1}.
      Which way of splitting do you think is fair to the both of you? ðŸ¤¨
  utter_2_fractions_halves_mcq_1_solution:
  - text: "The correct answer is option B!"
  utter_ask_3_fractions_halves_frq_1:
  - text: "*WHY* do you think this split is 'fair'?"
  utter_3_fractions_halves_frq_1_explanation:
  - text: By splitting the {object_1} in this way,  both you and {1_friend_1} get the same/ equal share.
  utter_fractions_halves_conclusion:
  - text: In fractions we would say that you and {1_friend_1} each got *one half (Â½)* of the *whole*
  utter_fractions_parts_story_form_1_object_2:
  - text: 'Right after you and {1_friend_1} finished your yummy (and equal!) {object_1}, {friend_2} sits at your table. /n {friend_2} has 3 snacks: biscuits, grapes and chocolates. Which is your favorite?'
  utter_ask_2_fractions_parts_nrq_1:
  - text: |-
      I love {1_object_2} too ðŸ˜‹!
      {friend_2} has 6 {1_object_2}. How many do you each get if you split them equally between the three of you?
  utter_2_fractions_parts_nrq_1_explanation:
  - text: https://ecceapi.herokuapp.com/media/audio/fractions_parts_nrq_1_explanation.ogg
  utter_ask_3_fractions_parts_mcq_1:
  - text: If each of you got 2 {1_object_2},  what part of the whole (6 {1_object_2}) did you get?
  utter_3_fractions_parts_mcq_1_options:
  - text: Lets try again. This time I'll give you options - 1/6 , 2/3 , 1/3, 1

    text: Listen to this!
  utter_ask_4_fractions_parts_mcq_2:
  - text: '{1_friend_1} gives you her 2 {object_1}.  Now you have 2 out of the 3 equal parts. Do you get more or less than {friend_2}?'

    text: This animation might help!
  utter_ask_5_fractions_parts_mcq_3:
  - text: '{friend_2} is upset that you got more than they do :( Now, he wants you to share the {1_object_2} EQUALLY between the two of you. /n If you split the object into 2 halves, do you get more or less than before?'
  utter_5_fractions_parts_mcq_3_explanation:
  - text: You split the food into two equal parts instead of three! Because there are fewer people to share with, each person now gets more {object_1}
  utter_ask_6_fractions_parts_mcq_4:
  - text: Let's talk about that in fractions! /n Is Â½ of the 6 {1_object_2} more or less than â…“ of the 6 {1_object_2}?

  - image: https://ecceapi.herokuapp.com/media/audio/fractions_parts_mcq_4_explanation.mp3
    text: Check this out
  utter_fractions_parts_conclusion:
  - text: You have now explored the concept of parts! It is as easy as splitting objects amongst different friends :)/n Now we're going to put **parts** together to make a **whole**!
  utter_fractions_wholes_introduction:
  - text: A farmer has a total of 12 MANGOES ðŸ¥­  which he needs to split into 3 equal parts.  You can help him with FRACTIONS!
  utter_fractions_wholes_introduction_hint:
  - text: Whenever we are dealing with fractions itâ€™s always a good idea to figure out what the *whole* is and what the *part* is.
  utter_ask_1_fractions_wholes_nrq_1:
  - text: If the farmer splits the whole of 12 mangoes into 3 equal boxes, how many mangoes are in each box?
  utter_1_fractions_wholes_nrq_1_explanation:
  - text: 12 split equally into 3 parts is 4. You can check that this is right by adding together all 3 equal parts/n  4 + 4 + 4  = 12 mangoes!
  utter_ask_2_fractions_wholes_nrq_2:
  - text: Let's talk about this in fractions! /n How much of the *whole* is in each box?
  utter_2_fractions_wholes_nrq_2_explanation:
  - text: You can also look at the 3 boxes as 3 equal parts. Each box is then 1 out of 3 parts or â…“ of the whole.
  utter_ask_3_fractions_wholes_frq_1:
  - text: The farmer was grateful for your help and gifted you a box of 4 mangoes. /n If you had to split this box into parts, what would be the whole?
  utter_3_fractions_wholes_frq_1_explanation:
  - image: https://ecceapi.herokuapp.com/media/audio/fractions_wholes_frq_1_explanation.ogg
    text: Hear why!
  utter_ask_4_fractions_wholes_nrq_3:
  - text: You split the mangoes evenly among 3 other family members, how many mangoes does each person get?
  utter_4_fractions_wholes_nrq_3_explanation:
  - text: When you split 4 mangoes equally between 4 people, each person gets 1 mango!
  utter_ask_5_fractions_wholes_nrq_4:
  - text: What fraction of the whole did each family member get?
  utter_5_fractions_wholes_nrq_4_explanation:
  - text: Each got 1 out of 4 parts, and so the fraction is Â¼
  utter_ask_6_fractions_wholes_nrq_5:
  - text: Now that youâ€™ve got one mango all to yourself, you want to cut your mango into 6 equal pieces. What fraction of the whole mango is each piece?
  utter_6_fractions_wholes_nrq_5_explanation:
  - text: You are cutting the mango into 6 equal parts so each slice of the mango is 1/6 of the whole.
  utter_fractions_wholes_conclusion:
  - text: Did you realise that the whole changed depending on what you're splitting?!
  utter_fractions_wholes_conclusion_1:
  - text: When the farmer was splitting 12 mangoes into 3 equal boxes, you identified 12 mangoes as the whole!
  utter_fractions_wholes_conclusion_2:
  - text: Later, when you had to share the box of 4 mangoes with your family, you identified 4 mangoes as the new whole!
  utter_fractions_wholes_conclusion_3:
  - text: Finally, when you were ready to eat one mango - you cut it into 6 slices. 1 mango was now the whole you are splitting into 6 parts!In fact, Fractions are how you divide/split *any whole*
